# Coinbase Design System - Vite Template

A fast and modern Vite application template integrated with the Coinbase Design System (CDS).

## Installation

Use `gitpick` to create a new project from this template:

```sh
npx -y gitpick coinbase/cds/tree/master/templates/vite-app cds-vite
cd cds-vite
```

## Setup

We suggest [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/tree/master) to manage Node.js versions. If you have it installed, you can use these commands to set the correct Node.js version. Using corepack ensures you have your package manager setup.

```sh
nvm install
nvm use
corepack enable
yarn
```

## Development

- `yarn dev` - Run the app in development mode
- `yarn build` - Build the app for production
- `yarn preview` - Preview the production build
