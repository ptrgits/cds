# Coinbase Design System

The Coinbase Design System (CDS) is a component library built with TypeScript. CDS provides a set of reusable React components that follow Coinbase's design principles and guidelines across web and mobile applications.

## Core Packages

The design system is organized into several core packages in the monorepo:

- Web components: import from the package.json exports defined in `@coinbase/cds-web` [package.json](mdc:packages/web/package.json)
- Mobile components: import from the package.json exports defined in `@coinbase/cds-mobile` [package.json](mdc:packages/mobile/package.json)
- Shared utilities: import from the package.json exports defined in `@coinbase/cds-common` [package.json](mdc:packages/common/package.json)
- Illustrations: import from the package.json exports defined in `@coinbase/illustrations` [package.json](mdc:packages/illustrations/package.json)
