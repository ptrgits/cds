### Basic Button Group

Uniformly group buttons with consistent spacing between each.

```jsx live
<ButtonGroup accessibilityLabel="Group" direction="vertical">
  <Button>Save</Button>
  <Button variant="secondary">Cancel</Button>
  <Button variant="negative">Delete</Button>
</ButtonGroup>
```

The group is rather easy to use, just render a list of buttons. However, there is a hard requirement that direct children _must_ be a `Button` or `IconButton` component. Do _not_ provide your own markup.

```jsx live
<ButtonGroup accessibilityLabel="Group">
  <Button>Save</Button>
  <Button transparent>Cancel</Button>
</ButtonGroup>
```

### Block Button Group

If you would like the buttons to expand and fill all available space, pass a `block` prop to the `ButtonGroup`.

```jsx live
<ButtonGroup block accessibilityLabel="Group">
  <Button>Save</Button>
  <Button variant="secondary">Cancel</Button>
</ButtonGroup>
```

> If you are using a component that composes around a button component, be sure to pass props from the group down correctly, like `block`.

### Icon buttons

Icon buttons are unique in that their shape is a circle, not a rectangle. Because of this, icon buttons do _not_ support the `block` prop.

```jsx live
<ButtonGroup accessibilityLabel="Group">
  <IconButton name="arrowLeft" />
  <IconButton name="arrowRight" />
</ButtonGroup>
```

### A11y

All button groups _require_ an accessibility label describing the group's contents.

```jsx
<ButtonGroup accessibilityLabel="Asset actions">
  <Button>Buy</Button>
  <Button>Sell</Button>
  <Button variant="secondary">Add to watchlist</Button>
</ButtonGroup>
```
